# Assessment-Task-Two
Scenario
You have accepted the role of a Mid-Level Programmer for CITE Managed Services working as part of a small team to design, code and test a series of algorithms. Your task is to demonstrate your teamwork skills and programming knowledge by producing a program that will process astronomical data which is streamed from a local observatory. The continuous data represents the interaction of neutrinos with earth matter which are amplified and stored in an array data structure for analysis. The demonstration of the final application will utilise simulated data. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_astronomy

Software Development Methodology
This team project will use an agile methodology to complete the development of the Astronomical Processing application. For detailed information about the agile software development methodology read the PDF documents in the Software Development section on Blackboard.

It is critical that all team members are familiar with every aspect of the development. There are three major milestones, the first two will be the assessment point which focuses on the Scrum Master (Sprint One or Sprint Two). The other team member will not submit and is not required to present the Sprint application or answer interview questions. The third milestone is for the whole team and represents the final assessment point for the project (Handover). The Weekly Schedule (shown below) outlines each of these milestones and the final group handover. As the development progresses the team will collect information, create mini-reports and develop the Astronomical Processing application.

Sprint One
At the local observatory the number of neutrino interactions per hour is saved as an integer value. The client wants to record and process these hourly values by storing them in an array of size 24. They require a forms-based GUI application which displays the data in a list box and uses text boxes and buttons for processing. Use the following client requirements to design a prototype of the user interface.

Client Requirements
•	All data is stored as integers in an array.
•	The client can use a text box input to search the array.
•	There are buttons that can sort and search the data.
•	There is an input field (text box) so data can be edited.
•	The name of the application should be Astronomical Processing.

Program Functionality
•	The array is of type integer.
•	The array has 24 elements to reflect the number of hours per day.
•	The sort method must be coded using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
•	The search method must be coded using the Binary Search algorithm.
•	A single text box is provided for the search input.
•	The program must generate an error message if the text box is empty.
•	The program must generate an error message if the search is not successful.
•	The program must generate a message if the search is successful.
•	The program must be able to edit data values.
•	The array is filled with random integers to simulate the data stream (numbers between 10 and 90).

Project Management and Source Control
During this project you will require a source control facility to save, edit and review the documents and programming code. If your do not have a GitHub* account then you will need to create one and share the project folder with your team and provide access to your lecturer if requested. There are several types of accounts; you should decide which type suits your requirements. GitHub also includes a Project Board option that can be used to manage the workflows (Sprints). This type of source control will be used in other SMTAFE courses.
Main Site: https://github.com/
Help Files: https://docs.github.com/en

It is the Scrum Master’s responsibility to manage the GitHub Project for each week. Complete the Sprint One information and assign team member(s) with tasks for each week; save a screen capture of your GitHub Project with associated notes. This information will be presented in Question Three.
*NOTE: GitHub is the recommended sources control, check with your lecturer if you wish to use an alternative.

Application and GUI Prototype Design
The team should meet and discuss the Sprint One Client Requirements and Program Functionality, using this information design a user interface that would be suitable for this application. The team should design, write and review the algorithm and pseudo code for the two major processing functions required by the Client (Binary Search and Bubble Sort). This meeting and the associated discussions must be fully documented and added to the source control for assessment. Ensure all documentation conforms to CITEMS organizational guidelines.



Question One
Instructions
Use the Sprint One Project Specifications template below to complete Question One, include suitable information for each of the sections. List all the Project Tasks and assign a Priority (Very Important = 1 to Least Important = 5). Next, list all the functional and non-functional requirements based on the client requirements and program functionality.




Question Two
Instructions
Fill in all sections of the GUI Design Specifications template. List all the UI components (buttons, text box, list box, etc) and describe what action or event are associated with each. Insert a detailed image/picture/screen capture of the GUI design, ensure all the features are identified and labelled.




Question Three
Instructions
CITE uses GitHub as the primary Version Control System (VCS), the Scrum Master should create a GitHub account (you can use your existing account). Ensure your development computer has Visual Studio installed with all the appropriate features to create and develop a C# .Net application. Open Visual Studio and create a new project; ensure the GitHub settings have been updated to reflect your GitHub account. Create a new repository for the project and check you have a local and remote (Cloud) instance of the repository.
Complete the following Manage Version Control System template to answer this question.
Consult with your lecturer if you wish to use an alternative source control service. Any alternative source control must support a local desktop installation.




Question Four
Sprint One Approval
The Scrum Master will arrange for the completed Sprint One Project Specification document to be reviewed by the Lecturer/Assessor for approval, sign off and feedback before the team starts Question Five and Six.
Your submission for approval of the Sprint One Project Specification will include:
•	Question One
o	Project Details,
o	Project Tasks,
o	Requirements (Functional and non-functional),
•	Question Two
o	Design Specifications (detailed diagram of the GUI design), 
o	GUI Layout,
•	Question Three
o	Manage Version Control System details (screen shots from source control)
